# Storage Area Explorer


Chrome Developer Tools extension which allows to:

   * inspect [Storage Area](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage.html) of [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html)
   * inspect HTML5 local&session storage
   * export storage contents as JSON into clipboard or file
   * import storage contents from clipboard or file


Currently, extension was removed from Chrome Store by Google, since they don't like `tabs` permission on extension.
Easiest way to use (until I fix the issue and is back in Chrome store) is to download source and load this as an unpacked extension


~~Install from latest stable 0.4.2 version from [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/storage-area-explorer/ocfjjjjhkpapocigimmppepjgfdecjkb)~~
